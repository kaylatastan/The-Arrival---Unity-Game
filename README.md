# The Arrival

**The Arrival** is an atmospheric narrative experience that explores the thin line between two states of existence. It follows a soul caught in the transition between a crumbling reality and a silent void, emphasizing the internal struggle of finding one’s identity when the world as they know it ceases to function.

## The Concept: A Tale of Two Worlds

The game is structured around the contrast between two distinct environments, each serving as a metaphor for a different stage of a psychological journey:

* **The Fallen City**: Represents the weight and chaos of a difficult past. The environment is designed with low-poly destruction to evoke a sense of loss and urgency.
* **The Infinite Void**: A place where time stands still and gravity is irrelevant. It serves as a reflective space where the player must choose to move forward or risk being lost forever in the stillness.

## Technical Highlights

As a project developed during my final year in Computer Engineering, **The Arrival** integrates several core game development principles and technical implementations:

### 1. Scripting & Architecture (C#)
* **State Management**: Implemented custom logic to handle the transition between scenes, ensuring that player progress and narrative cues are preserved during the shift from the City to the Void.
* **Movement Systems**: Developed a responsive controller that adapts to the different physical rules of each dimension, transitioning from grounded exploration to a more ethereal feel in the void.

### 2. Visuals & Atmospheric Shaders
* **Custom Shaders (ShaderLab/HLSL)**: To achieve the specific "void" feeling, I utilized ShaderLab and HLSL to create environmental effects that emphasize the lack of traditional lighting and gravity.
* **Lighting Design**: The visual narrative is driven by a carefully crafted color palette, moving from the muddy, dark tones of the city to the soft, glowing ambiguity of the second dimension.

### 3. Mobile Optimization & UI
* **Intuitive Controls**: The project features a custom mobile UI with on-screen joysticks and action buttons, optimized for a seamless experience on touch devices.
* **Performance**: Optimized assets and light-mapping techniques to ensure stable frame rates across various hardware specifications.

## The Vision

This project is more than just a game; it is an exploration of the "stuck" moments in life. It highlights the courage required to continue walking when there is no clear path. By combining narrative depth with technical execution in Unity, I aimed to create a world that resonates with anyone who has ever searched for meaning in a moment of silence.
